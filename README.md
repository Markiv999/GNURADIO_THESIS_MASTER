# GNURADIO_THESIS_MASTER
GNU radio files for thesis, repository still messy. 
For a starter, look inside Delfi Board Correlation folder. 
TransmissionTest2Final (+edited) is the file used for transmission and recording. Tranformer is run for quadrature demodulation before correlation 
(grc file of transformer is lost unfortunately).
Any of the correlation files under Different Rate folder are reasonably upto date.
Encoder code is not uploaded here yet for safety reasons.

TODO for this repo:
Clean Up Work.
See if encoder code can be added.
